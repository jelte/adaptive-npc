# adaptive-npc

At the moment my goal is to create a little game with Adaptive NPC's (Agents).

## Goals
- NPC's do not have strict behaviours but adapt and persue their own agenda's.

## Current State of the AI
- An agent can move around, explore and inspect Points Of Interest (POI).



# Developers note

This is a little pet project of mine to improve my C# and Unity3d understanding. So any tips for improvements are welcome!
